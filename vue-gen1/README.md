# Svelte 4 Project integrated with Builder.io


To Get Started:
Add your Builder API Key to src/App.vue
Note: The model name is 'vue-page', a page model I created in my Builder space due to the fact that Vue uses localhost:5173 and not localhost:3000. 
This makes it so that I don't have to change the preview URL in Builder every time I want to preview my Vue app.

To run the app:
npm run dev
