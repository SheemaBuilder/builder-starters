# Next.js 14 Project integrated with Builder.io

At the time of creation, this project is using Next.js 14.2.23.
Next.js 15 introduces Turbopack, which is incompatible with the Builder CLI. See this forum post: https://forum.builder.io/t/turbopack-incompatibility-with-builder-ios-devtools-cli/7655/


To Get Started:
Change the .env file to include your Builder API key
Change the page model name in the app/[...page]/page.tsx file (if yours is different from the default "page")
